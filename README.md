git clone 
git status

Untracked -- new files that git does'nt track

modified --changed

staged -- file is ready to commit 

after doing any changes the files must be add &commit

Gitadd -- addes new files and working directories to git stage area

So when ever we add a new file or if we did any changes to the file which are already existed now 
we use gitadd (the fiels will be in staging area)
and now git status to check weather they are in stating or not!!


Commmit is like record of the changes which are done to the files
and by writing a message

The files which we add using add(and file name) and then commited using(gitcommint"adding a message")
now if we want to see them in the github repo we have to use 
PUSH command

PUSH:Upload local repo content to remote repo  git push origin main
Now we Are pushing it from local to GIT(remote)
